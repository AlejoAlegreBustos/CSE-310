### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  I had to replan how the website/app is going to use the ML model, so I try many things, but the FastApi was the one that fits better with my idea
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  by reviewing my plan I found out that my target was not right on my ML model, so I reviewed the data set documentation and change my focus on it, it stills working pretty accurate
- How can you improve in the next module?
  probably talk with bro McGary or someone else to have a clear image of what is next
