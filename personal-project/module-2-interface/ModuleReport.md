### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  
  It was good to review how classes work first, it help me to understand quickly how flutter works

- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  aws going down

- How can you improve in the next module?
  
  I am going to start building more screens for the web and also some functions, so it would be better to start earlier than this time
