### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
 sometimes is better to draft the work flow project on paper or somewhere else before to start coding it
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  I should write down the work flow of the project with all its components before to coding it
- How can you improve in the next module?
  In next project I will write the work flow project witn the MPV
