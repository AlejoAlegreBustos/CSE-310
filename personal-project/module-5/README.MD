Startup Prediction App (Flutter Frontend)

This is the mobile application (Frontend) built with Flutter. It connects to a FastAPI prediction service and a Supabase database to manage users, generate predictions, and save reports.

What it does

User Authentication: Secure login using Supabase.

Data Collection: A detailed form to collect 29 startup metrics (financials, dates, tags).

Prediction: Sends data to an ML model (XGBoost) to predict IPO success.

Review & Save: Displays the prediction result immediately and allows the user to decide whether to save it to the database.

Report Management: Lists saved reports and allows PDF downloading.

Key Files & Responsibilities

1. Authentication

login.dart: The login screen UI.

login_provider.dart: Manages login state (loading, current user).

supabase_service.dart: Handles direct communication with Supabase for authentication.

2. Form & Data Handling

form.dart (SecondPage): The main input screen. It uses MultiProvider to connect the form data with the prediction logic.

provider_form.dart: Manages the state of all text fields and dropdowns. Crucial: It contains buildJsonForApi(), which converts all inputs (booleans, ints) into a strict List<double> to prevent API errors.

3. Prediction Logic

prediction_provider.dart:

fetchPrediction(): Sends data to the API and holds the result temporarily.

saveReport(): Called explicitly by the user to save the prediction metadata to Supabase.

api_service.dart: The HTTP layer. Contains endpoints for /predict, /save-report, and /download.

4. Reports

myreports.dart: Displays a list of the user's history of reports.

report_provider.dart: Fetches the list of reports from the reports table in Supabase and handles PDF downloads via the browser.

How it works

Login: The user logs in via LoginPage. The app retrieves the correct userId.

Input: The user fills out the startup details in SecondPage.

Predict: - The app converts form data to a list of floats.

Sends it to POST /predict.

The server returns the result (IPO/No IPO) and a temporary filename.

Review: A modal pops up showing the result. The user can click "Save Report".

Save: The app calls POST /save-report to permanently store the result in Supabase linked to the userId.

History: The user can view and download past reports in the "My Reports" tab.

Notes

State Management: Built entirely using the Provider package for clean separation of UI and logic.

Data Safety: The app strictly validates data types before sending them to the backend to ensure compatibility with the XGBoost model.

PDFs: Reports are generated by the backend; the frontend simply handles the download link.
