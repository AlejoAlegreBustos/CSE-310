|Alejo Alegre Bustos|11/17/2025|Teacher: Bro McGary|


### Software Description 
The main idea for this sprint is to build a log-in page, a profile user page and update the data processing page as descripted bellow:

- Log-in page
    - username and password verification
- Profile user
   - it will show user personal reports
   - history of requests
   - name
   - basic settings
- Data processing
   - as the xgboost module requires 289 features I will modify this page to help the user enter those features indirectly by updating the data form
