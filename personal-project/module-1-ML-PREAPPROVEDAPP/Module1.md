### Software Description 
For this module I am going to develop a machine learning module to predict if a user of the final app is eligable fro a loan or not. If it is not, it is going to give you some tips to improve your credit condition
    - I am going to use XGBOOST a gradient boosting tecnic to classify the new information(user info)
    - I am going to use a data set from kaggle to train this module(https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/itsmesunil/bank-loan-modelling)
    - the output for this module will 1 or 0

### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

|**Friday**   | Cleaning Data   |Final draft                   |		
|**Saturday** | Tokenization    |Test module new data          |


### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

||Risk|Action Plan|
