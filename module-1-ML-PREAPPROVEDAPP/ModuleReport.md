### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?

I spend most of the time understanding the data, that gave a good hint for what algorithm I would use, so that worked really well in this case, and I saved a lot of time in training by randomly generating model configurations to understand which parameter ranges work best in this case.  

- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?

The set up for the video took more time than I was expectited,for next time I won't let that for in last place.

- How can you improve in the next module?

In my next module, I am going to be working on the interface, an area where I do not have any experience, so I will be learning a lot the first week.
