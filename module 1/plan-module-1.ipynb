    "### Software Description \n",
    "For this module I am going to develop a machine learning module to predict if a user of the final app is eligable fro a loan or not. If it is not, it is going to give you some tips to improve your credit condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I am going to use **XGBoost**, a gradient boosting technique, to classify the new information (user info).\n",
    "- I am going to use a dataset from Kaggle to train this model: [Bank Loan Modelling](https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/itsmesunil/bank-loan-modelling).\n",
    "- The output for this model will be **1** or **0**.\n",

You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.\n",
